# A BBEdit Codeless Language Module for Swift

## Status

I’m actively updating this now. Keyword, comment, and string highlighting are all that work at the moment.

## Installation

1. Copy the file *swift.plist* to *~/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules*. You may have to create the *Langauge Modules* folder if it doesn’t exist.
2. Quit and relaunch BBEdit.

Now files with the extension “swift” should be syntax highlighted. <!-- The function popup menu in the navigation bar should also list all the declarations in the current file. -->

## Known Issues

- No function indexing
